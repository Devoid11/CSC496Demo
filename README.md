# CSC496Demo

A repository for experimenting with git and a place to put homework for CSC496

Benchmarks:

I choose the game Death Stranding as a benchmark test as it is an open world game with high-end graphics. The game is fairly high-end and one of the most modern games I own. To run the bench mark I used both afterburner and HWinfo64. For each I opened and ran the program and interacted with the enviornment (making sure to leave an area to prompt the next to load). The results showed that the computer handles it rather smoothly (as the average FPS and max FPS were high) but lags during area loads. 

I also used the game Baldur's gate as it is left graphically heavy but manages a lot of computation. I used the same software for this game, and interacted with the enviornment in a similar way as Death Stranding, one difference being I made sure to interact with a combat encounter as well. The results showed that Baldur's Gate managed to maintain a pretty even CPU temp. but was far less consistent in terms of FPS.

Both tests were ran on my own personal laptop (ROG STRIX G)
